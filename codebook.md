### Codebook - getting and Cleaning Data

The are 6 diffrent possabilities for the subject:

"Walking" - the subject was walking
"Walking upstairs" - the subject was walking upstairs
"Walking downstairs" - the subject was walking downstairs
"Sitting" - the subject was sitting
"Laying" - the subject was laying
"Standing" - the subject was standing

For each of the possibilities above there where diffrent variables that were measured

"subject" - the "name" of the subject
"activity" - the activity the subject was doing (see possibilities above)
